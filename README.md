# Taskify

A minimalist Notion clone.

Taskify can be used to plan and keep track of your tasks, either individually or under different projects, and take notes.

Taskify is built using ReactJS and Styled Components for UI, React Router for client-side routing, Firebase as backend and Firestore as DB.
